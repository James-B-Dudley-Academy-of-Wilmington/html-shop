# Step 5: Add your images to your website!


#### Adding images in HTML is very easy. You just have to know the names of your image files.

- Use an `<img` HTML tag
- Remember to use your double quotes!
- Change the size of your image by changing the `width="300"` _attribute_

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>
  <style>

  </style>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>My Website Name</h1>

  <img src="myimagename.png" width="200">

</body>

</html>

```

### **REFRESH** your website in your Web Browser - do you see your image?


## Awesome! You have completed the first steps to building your shop ðŸ”¥

Experiement with the following HTML tags:

```
<p>What does the p tag do?</p>

<h3>The h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 tags are different title headers</h3>

```
