#### Now it's time for awesomeness

In our `index.html` file, we need to setup the initial HTML code so we start on the right foot.

- Your `head` is on top of your `body` right?

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>
  <style>

  </style>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>My Website Name</h1>
</body>

</html>

```

## Open your website

In your file folder explorer, go to your project folder and OPEN your `index.html` file. You should see your website name!

### Does your `index.html` file have all the HTML above in it? If so, continue to next step!
